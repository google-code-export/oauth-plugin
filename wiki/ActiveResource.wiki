#summary Thoughs on ActiveResource support

= Introduction =

ActiveResource is the Rails 2.0 way of doing REST web services from the client side. It would be great to be able to support OAuth directly in ActiveResource through a plugin.

= Details =

To use ActiveResource with OAuth you would need an AccessToken issued for the user already.

My idea is that you should be able to some how be able to set the access_token like you would set a site today.

AccessToken supports most of the methods of the ActiveResource::Connection object so it should just really be a matter of wiring it up.
