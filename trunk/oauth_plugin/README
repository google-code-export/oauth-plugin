= OAuth Plugin

This is the beginning of a plugin for implementing both OAuth clients and servers in Rails applications.

See the OAuth specs at:

http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/spec/branches/1.0/drafts/7/spec.html

and the OAuth site at:

http://oauth.net

== Requirements

You need to install the oauth gem
  
  sudo gem install oauth

This is a change from earlier versions that had the code within the plugin. 

The Generator currently creates code (in particular views) that only work in Rails 2.

It should not be difficult to manually modify the code to work on Rails 1.2.x

I think the only real issue is that the views have .html.erb extensions. So these could theoretically just be renamed to .rhtml.

Please let me know if this works and I will see if I can make the generator conditionally create .rhtml for pre 2.0 versions of RAILS.

== OAuth Provider generator

While it isn't very flexible at the moment there is an oauth_provider generator which you can use like this:

./script/generate oauth_provider

This generates an oauth_controller as well as the required models.

It requires an authentication framework such as acts_as_authenticated, restful_authentication or restful_open_id_authentication. It also requires Rails 2.0.

Please help documentation, patches and testing.
